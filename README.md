## 📊 Week 1 – Dataset Preparation
The dataset simulates real farm data for **20 days**, including soil moisture, rainfall, temperature, crop type, and irrigation requirement.

📂 Files:  
- [`week1/Smart_Irrigation_Week1_Dataset.csv`](./week1/Smart_Irrigation_Week1_Dataset.csv)  
- [`week1/Smart_Irrigation_Week1_Dataset.xlsx`](./week1/Smart_Irrigation_Week1_Dataset.xlsx)  
- [`week1/Week1_Report.pdf`](./week1/Week1_Report.pdf)

## 🤖 Week 2 – Prototype Development
In Week 2, a **Python-based rule engine** was developed to automatically predict irrigation requirements.

### 🔹 Methodology
- Rule: If `Soil Moisture < 30%` and `Rainfall < 5mm` → **Irrigation Required = Yes**  
- Otherwise → **No irrigation needed**  
- Implemented using **pandas** for data processing and **matplotlib** for visualization  

### 📂 Week 2 Files
- [`week2/Week2_Output_With_Predictions.csv`](./week2/Week2_Output_With_Predictions.csv) – Predictions output  
- [`week2/week2_irrigation_advisor.py`](./week2/week2_irrigation_advisor.py) – Python prototype code  
- [`week2/Week2_Report.pdf`](./week2/Week2_Report.pdf) – Week 2 Report (PDF)  
- [`week2/Week2_Report.docx`](./week2/Week2_Report.docx) – Week 2 Report (Word)  

### ✅ Results
- Predictions achieved **100% accuracy** compared to Week 1 dataset.  
- Scatter plot shows irrigation requirement (Yes = Red, No = Green).

## 🚀 Next Steps (Week 3)
- Expand dataset (50–100 rows, more crops).  
- Upgrade system to **Machine Learning (Decision Trees/Random Forests)**.  
- Build a simple **user interface** for farmers.  
- Prepare **final project report + presentation**.
